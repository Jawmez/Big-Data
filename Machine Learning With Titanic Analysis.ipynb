    "After running each training module ten times, with unique values, I concluded that each test had an accuracy score of around 70% to 80%. After running this section multiple times, I found that both the Random Forest and Tree methods are more accurate than the Neighbors method. Neighbors typically returned an accuracy score in the low 70%s. Both Random Forest and Three ran an accuracy score in the upper 70%s. These two results where very identical. I decided to use Random Forest for my main method of prediction. I chose random forest over tree because Random Forest uses multiple algorithims, training sets and prediction codes (hence forest), while the tree module only has access to one. "

    "This final section looks at class and gender. This final section showed the notable importance of gender for determining survival. These results show that all females, regardless of there status as crew or class, where predicted to survive on the titanic. The data shows that regardless of crew position or class, all males where predicted to die. In conclusion for this section, I found that gender was the biggest determining factor in predicting whether someone on board the titanic would survive or not. "

    "In conclusion, I found that there are many ways to predict an outcome of an event using certain variables. I am curious to learn how the computer sorts data and determines an outcome. I am still unsure on the process of testing a sample's accuracy score when one line (varibale) is removed from the test data. I got many index mismatch errors. Because I was confused by the accuracy scores in this section, I also ran each possible outcome for each section when one variable was removed. From these outcomes, I was able to find and identify trends in data. \n",

I also learned how to take an apply an accuracy score to a data set to determine the accuracy of the machine prediction. While there are many public prediction methods available for use, there are cases where a specific model may be better than another model. It is important to check the prediciton accuracy or each model before choosing the appropriate machine learning method to use.  \n",

I had initially thought that children would have the highest survival rate amongst the passangers. This hypothesis was disproved in my variable tests, where I found that male children where predicted to die while female children where predicted to survive. "
